    "## Project for Section 3.1: Is AIDS an Invariably Fatal Disease?\n",
    "by Ivan Kramer\n",
    "\n",
    "This essay will address and answer the question: Is the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is the end stage of the human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection, an invariably fatal disease? \n",
    "\n",
    "Like other viruses, HIV has no metabolism and cannot reproduce itself outside of a living cell. The genetic information of the virus is contained in two identical strands of RNA. To reproduce, HIV must use the reproductive apparatus of the cell it invades and infects to produce exact copies of the viral RNA. Once it penetrates a cell, HIV transcribes its RNA into DNA using an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) contained in theD virus. The double-stranded viral DNA migrates into the nucleus of the invaded cell and is inserted into the cell's genome with the aid of another viral enzyme (integrase). The Cell infected with HIV viral DNA and the invaded cell's DNA are then integrated, and the cell is infected. When the infected cell is stimulated to reproduce, the proviral DNA is transcribed into viral DNA, and new viral particles are synthesized. Since anti-retroviral drugs like zi-dovudine inhibit the HIV enzyme reverse transcriptase and stop proviral DNA chain synthesis in the laboratory, these drugs, usually administered in combination, slow down the progression to AIDS in those that are infected with HIV (hosts).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes HIV infection so dangerous is the fact that it fatally weakens a host's immune system by binding to the CD4 molecule on the surface of cells vital for defense against disease, including T-helper cells and a subpopulation of natural killer cells. T-helper cells (CD4 T-cells, or T4 cells) are arguably the most important cells of the immune system since they organize the body's defense against antigens. Modeling suggests that HIV infection of natural killer cells makes it impossible for even modern antiretroviral therapy to clear the virus. In addition to the CD4 molecule, a virion needs at least one of a handful of co-receptor molecules (e.g., CCR5 and CXCR4) on the surface of the target cell in order to be able to bind to it, penetrate its membrane, and infect it. Indeed, about 1% of Caucasians lack coreceptor molecules, and, therefore, are completely immune to becoming HIV infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once infection is established, the disease enters the acute infection stage, lasting a matter of weeks, followed by an incubation period, which can last two decades or more! Although the T-helper cell density of a host changes quasi-statically during the incubation period, literally billions of infected T4 cells and HIV particles are destroyed -and replaced- daily. This is clearly a war of attrition, one in which the immune system invariably loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model analysis of the essential dynamics that occur during the incubation period to invariably cause AIDS is as follows. Because HIV rapidly mutates, its ability to infect T4 cells on contact (its infectivity) eventually increases and the rate T4 cells become infected increases. Thus, the immune system must increase the destruction rate of infected T4 cells as well as the production rate of new, uninfected ones to replace them. There comes a point, however, when the production rate of T4 cells reaches its maximum possible limit and any further increase in HIV’s infectivity must necessarily cause a drop in the T4 density leading to AIDS. Remarkably, about 5% of hosts show no sign of immune system deterioration for the first ten years of the infection; these hosts, called long-term nonprogressors, were originally thought to be possibly immune to developing AIDS, but modeling evidence suggests that these hosts will also develop AIDS eventually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In over $95%$ of hosts, the immune system gradually loses its long battle with the virus. The T4 cell density in the peripheral blood of hosts begins to drop from normal levels (between $250$ over $2500$ $cells/mm^3$) towards zero, signaling the end of the incubation period. The host reaches the AIDS stage of the infection either when one of the more than twenty opportunistic infections characteristic of AIDS develops (clinical AIDS) or when the T4 cell density falls below $250$ $cells/mm^3$ (an additional definition of AIDS promulgated by the CDC in 1987). The HIV infection has now reached its potentially fatal stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to model survivability with AIDS, the time $t$ at which a host develops AIDS will be denoted by $t=0$. One possible survival model for a cohort of AIDS patients postulates that AIDS is not a fatal condition for a fraction of the cohort, denoted by $S_i$, to be called the immortal fraction here. For the remaining part of the cohort, the probability of dying per unit time at time $t$ will be assumed to be a constant $k$, where, of course, $k$ must be positive. Thus, the survival fraction $S(t)$ for this model is a solution of the linear first-order differential equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d S}{d t} = -k[S(t) - S_i] \\qquad S(0) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the integrating-factor method discussed in __Section $2.3$__, we see that the solution of equation for the survival fraction is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S(t) = S_i + (1-S_i)e^{-kt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the parameter $k$ appearing in, two new parameters can be defined for a host for whom AIDS is fatal: the _average survival time_ $T_{aver}$ given by $T_{aver}=  k^{-1}$ and the _survival half-life_ $T_{1/2}$ given by $T_{1/2} = ln(2)/k$. The survival half-life, defined as the\n",
    "time required for half of the cohort to die, is completely analogous to the half-life in radioactive nuclear decay. In terms of these parameters\n",
    "the entire time-dependence in can be written as\n",

    "## Project for Section 3.3 Wolf Population Dynamics\n",
    "by C. J. Knickerbocker\n",
    "\n",
    "Early in $1995$, after much controversy, public debate, and a $70$-year absence, gray wolves were re introduced into Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho. During this $70$-year absence, significant changes were recorded in the populations of other predator and prey animals residing in the park. For instance, the elk and coyote populations had risen in the absence of influence from the larger gray wolf. With the reintroduction of the wolf in 1995, we anticipated changes in both the predator and prey animal populations in the Yellowstone Park ecosystem as the success of the wolf population is dependent upon how it influences and is influenced by the other  species in the ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, we will examine how the elk (prey) population has been influenced by the wolves (predator). Recent studies have shown that the elk population has been negatively impacted by the reintroduction of the wolves. The elk population fell from approximately $18,000$ in $1995$ to approximately $7,000$ in $2009$. This article asks the question of whether the wolves could have such an effect and, if so, could the elk population disappear?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a more detailed look at the changes in the elk population independent of the wolves. In the $10$ years prior to the introduction of wolves, from $1985$ to $1995$, one study suggested that the elk population increased by $40\\%$ from $13,000$ in $1985$ to $18,000$ in $1995$. Using the simplest differential equation model for population dynamics, we can determine the growth rate for elks (represented by the variable $r$) prior to the reintroduction of the wolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d E}{d t} = r E, \\qquad E(0) = 13.0, \\quad E(10)=18.0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, $E(t)$ represents the elk population (in thousands) where $t$ is measured in years since $1985$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SOLUTION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of the separable equation is:\n",
    "$$ E(t) = c e^{rt} \\qquad \\implies \\qquad E(0) = c = 13.0 \\qquad \\implies \\qquad E(10) = 13 e^{10r} = 18 \\qquad \\implies \\qquad r = \\frac{1}{10}log\\left(\\frac{18}{13}\\right) = 0.0325422$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined birth/death growth rate $r$ is approximately $0.0325$ yielding:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(t) = 13 e^{0.0325 t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In $1995$, $21$ wolves were initially released, and their numbers have risen. In $2007$, biologists estimated the number of wolves to be approximately $171$. To study the interaction between the elk and wolf populations, let's consider the following predator-prey model for the interaction between the elk and wolf within the Yellowstone ecosystem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d E}{d t}=0.0325 E-0.8 E W $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d W}{d t}=-0.6 W+0.05 E W $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(0)=18.0 \\quad W(0)=0.021$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E(t)$ is the elk population and $W(t)$ is the wolf population. All populations are measured in thousands of animals. The variable $t$ represents time measured in years from $1995$. So, from the initial conditions, we have $18,000$ elk and 21 wolves in the year $1995$. The estimated growth rate for the elk is assumed to be the same as that estimated above $r = 0.0325$. __Note:__ _This is consistent with the assumption that without accounting  for the influence of wolves the elk population would grow at the rate estimated before._\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we attempt to solve the model, a qualitative analysis of the system can yield a number of interesting properties of the solutions. The first equation shows that the growth rate of the elk $(dE/dt)$ is positively impacted by the size of the herd $(0.0325E)$. This can be interpreted as the probability of breeding increases with the number of elk. On the other hand the nonlinear term $(0.8EW)$ has a negative impact on the growth rate of the elk since it measures the interaction between predator and prey. The second equation $dW/dt = -0.6W + 0.05EW$ shows that the wolf population has a negative effect on its own growth which can be interpreted as more wolves create more competition for food. But, the interaction between the elk and wolves $(0.05EW)$ has a positive impact since the wolves are finding more food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since an analytical solution cannot be found to the initial-value problem, we need to rely on technology to find approximate solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bellow is an example on how to find the numerical solution using the package `DifferentialEquations.jl` in `Julia`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a system of differential equations in `DifferentialEquations.jl`, we define our `f` as a vector function with a vector initial condition. Thus, for the vector `u = [E, W]'`, we have the derivative function:"

    "The following graphs show the populations for both species between $1995$ and $2009$. As predicted by numerous studies, the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone had led to a decline in the elk population. In this model, we see the population decline from $18,000$ in $1995$ to approximately $7,000$ in $2009$. In contrast, the wolf population rose from an initial count of $21$ in 1995 to a high of approximately $180$ in $2004$."

    "\n",
    "The dynamics of an epidemic, for example, the flu, are often much faster than the dynamics of birth and death, therefore, birth and death are often omitted in simple compartmental models. The SIR system without so-called vital dynamics (birth and death, sometimes called demography) described above can be expressed by the following set of ordinary differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&\\frac{d S}{d t}=-\\frac{\\beta I S}{N}\\\\\n",
    "&\\frac{d I}{d t}=\\frac{\\beta I S}{N}-\\gamma I\\\\\n",
    "&\\frac{d R}{d t}=\\gamma I\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the stock of susceptible population, $I$ is the stock of infected, $R$ is the stock of removed population (either by death or recovery), and $N$, the total population, is the sum of these three.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly note that from:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d S}{d t}+\\frac{d I}{d t}+\\frac{d R}{d t}=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "it follows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S(t)+I(t)+R(t)= \\text{constant} =N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "expressing in mathematical terms the constancy of population $N$. Note that the above relationship implies that one need only study the equation for two of the three variables.\n",
    "Secondly, we note that the dynamics of the infectious class depends on the following ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{0}=\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the so-called basic reproduction number (also called basic reproduction ratio). This ratio is derived as the expected number of new infections (these new infections are sometimes called secondary infections) from a single infection in a population where all subjects are susceptible. This idea can probably be more readily seen if we say that the typical time between contacts is $T_{c}=\\beta ^{-1}$, and the typical time until recovery is $T_{r}=\\gamma ^{-1}$. From here it follows that, on average, the number of contacts by an infected individual with others before the infected has recovered is: $T_{r}/T_{c}$."
